# Cosine-Text-Similarity-Algorithm
This repository contains Cosine text similarity algorithm to compare 2 documents.

<p>
So if we want to compare 2 files i.e. 'file1' and 'file2', and we have 3rd file containing all the tokens in file 'term_list' <br>
This algorithm works on the formula : (a*b) / ||a|| . ||b||  <br>
Here a and b is the frequency of 'file1' and 'file2' respectively. <br>
